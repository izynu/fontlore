Variable build: no. Serve static weights.

| 400 | available |

## Where it fits

- Headlines, posters, and hero sections
- Short, high-impact strings rather than paragraphs
- Brand moments that need a distinct voice

## Where it does not fit

- Body text and small sizes: most display designs collapse below 20 px
- Data-dense layouts that need tabular figures

## License notes

Released under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. The family may be used, studied, modified, embedded, and bundled in commercial and personal work. Selling the font files on their own is the only prohibited use. If a Reserved Font Name applies, modified versions must be renamed.

Always verify against the source page: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface

## How to load it

- npm package: `@fontsource/abril-fatface`
- CDN stylesheet: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontsource/css/abril-fatface@latest/index.css`
- Implementation details, axis usage, and fallback strategy: see the implementation guide below.

## Common mistakes

- Requesting weights the family does not ship; browsers will synthesize bold or light and wreck the color.
- Serving every static weight when the page uses two; subset the list first.
- Treating this overview as license advice; the license text at the source URL is the authority.
- Skipping a real-copy test because the catalog preview looked right.
